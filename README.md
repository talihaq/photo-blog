Project Learning Log

Hello,

This is an example of a simple photography blog displaying a selection of 9 photographs. 

This project started off as an exercise which was a part of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp 2022, but I added quirks, like changing font colour on hover and image opacity on hover, and I added a transition property.

The purpose of this exercise was to practise adding fonts and images, adjusting image sizes, margins, spacing, font styling, using responsive units. All with HTML and CSS.

Skills: adding images, transitions, opacity, pseudo classes, semantic HTML, embedding fonts
